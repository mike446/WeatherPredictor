# WeatherPredictor
Currently, the proposed experiments to test the effectiveness of the AI are simple. Once the AI has cleared through testing data, it will be introduced to new weather data that it has not been exposed to before. This will be done in two ways. The first way will be using data from older forecasts, and seeing if the AI’s prediction will match the actual weather from the record. The second way will be for it to receive data from a recent forecast and see if it will be able to predict up to a certain time in the future.

Weather Parameters?
Wind speed(metre/sec)
Wind gust (metre/sec)
Current clouds (cloud percentage)
Humidity
Pressure
Temperature
precipitation



Weather Parameters(Input)
Location(Latitude and Longitude)
Idea: User can input an address and we can convert that to latitude and longitude(Google Maps Geocoding API)??


Weather Output
We can define prompts based on output for example: 
Expect a day of partly cloudy with rain
